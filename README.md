Credit Calculator API â€” Full Stack Project



This project was developed by Emirhan Efe GÃ¶zpÄ±nar during his internship at VakÄ±fBank.



&nbsp;Overview



Credit Calculator API is a full-stack financial application that provides a secure, scalable, and real-time credit application and management system.



Users can:



Register securely with JWT and AES-256 encryption.



Verify their accounts through email verification.



Perform credit installment (itfa) calculations.



Apply to become a customer of a bank.



View and apply for bank campaigns filtered by bank and credit type.



Administrators can:



Manage users, banks, and campaigns from a centralized admin panel.



Approve, reject, or update credit and membership applications.



Monitor system health and application metrics through Prometheus and Grafana alerts.



The system:



Uses Kafka for asynchronous risk evaluation and real-time status updates.



Continuously logs activities and performance metrics.



Ensures sensitive data is securely encrypted and auditable.

&nbsp;System Architecture



Backend (.NET Core) â†’ Provides RESTful APIs, handles authentication, encryption, and business logic.



Frontend (Angular 20) â†’ Offers a modern UI for users and admins.



Kafka â†’ Manages event-driven communication for risk evaluation and logging.



Prometheus + Grafana â†’ Collects and visualizes application metrics with alerting mechanisms.



Databases â†’ MSSQL (primary) and MongoDB (read model + logs).
